# Day report, 2026-10-11

Plan: [OVERNIGHT_PLAN.md](OVERNIGHT_PLAN.md). Updated after every block. Last night's files are
archived as `docs/archive/OVERNIGHT_{PLAN,REPORT}_2026-10-11.md`.

**Bench at 04:47 UTC:** api healthy; worker, page pool and previews answer a Celery ping; beat
scheduling; nothing had died. `app-prod` was stopped (started for measurements). **Browser tool:**
the Playwright MCP connects and drives the app; smokes run on the throwaway
`fx.day1011.a@bench.intelcost.io`.

| # | Block | State | Commits |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | Drop stashes | **done**: `overnight-simd`, `overnight-simd2`, `overnight-cnl` dropped (app has no stash) | — |
| 2 | "C" next-scan re-measure | **done**: machine load; the change's own cost cut where it was largest | see block 2 |
| 1 | Sheet delete storage | in progress | |
| 3 | Auto Count fill check | not started | |
| 4 | First page before the whole file | not started | |
| 6 | Stretch: Duplicate project | not started | |

## 2. Auto Count "C" next-scan re-measure (D-346)

Run first, on a quiet machine: the dev server, api, workers, beat and marketing stopped for the
measurement (they poll the Windows share; the Docker VM sat at a load of 10–11), only `app-prod`
serving, host near idle. Production build, 3 runs each, interleaved:

| Median (range) | "C" first | **"C" next** | office next | E200 A first / next | A1 next |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Shipped (D-343) | 15.2 s | **13.6 s** (13.2–14.5) | 8.0 s | 23.8 / 21.0 s | 4.4 s |
| `?exact=0&solo=off` (before D-343) | 14.3 s | **12.6 s** (12.6–13.0) | 7.9 s | 22.0 / 19.7 s | 4.0 s |

**Verdict: machine load.** Quiet, every scan runs about twice as fast as last night's figures, and
"C" next is 12.6–14.5 s either way, not 17.5 → 23.9. **The change has a cost of its own**, though:
on "C" alone, 3 × 3 runs isolate it to the exact search (shipped 13.6 s, `?exact=0` 13.0 s, the
one-size consensus nothing), and E200 A pays about 1.3 s.

**Cut, results unchanged:** the exact search now skips, per size, the strong peaks where the grid
already found a hit of that size within the peak's error. Box-by-box and score-by-score comparison
with the D-343 search (`?exactall=1`), 3 runs each, all four tests, 70 % and 38 %: **identical**.

| Next scan, median of 3 | E200 A | office | "C" | A1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-343 search everywhere | 20.8 s | 8.1 s | 12.9 s | 4.0 s |
| **Skip where found** | **19.9 s** | **7.7 s** | 13.0 s | 4.2 s |

"C" and A1 are within the ±0.5 s noise. Reviews on every run: office 68/0, "C" 24/0 (2 C/NL),
E200 A 12/0, A1 6/0 (5 suggestions).

**Gates:** app lint, typecheck, build OK; quantity table 329 rows, passed. **Smoke** (dev app,
throwaway): an E200 copy dropped on the empty start, boxed one A1, Image mode → Create (6), five at
100 % and one at 97 %, the same as last night: **passed**.
